# Weather App

For now, this is just an exercise on Javascript and API's. 

It's base was constructed with GreatStack video tutorial, but I plan to expand some features and revamp it's design.

## To-do List

* Load user data at start of app
* Add Style according to time of day
* Add tooltips with suggestions for the climate
